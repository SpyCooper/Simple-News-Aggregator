# Simple-News-Aggregator
**NOTE: To run the program, you need to make a folders included in the files in the same location as aggregator.py. The .txt files do not need to be there but the folders themselves do.**

## Project description
This is a program the goes through https://www.cnn.com/, https://www.bbc.com/news, https://www.pcgamer.com/, and https://www.gamesradar.com/ to get each websties trending and/or recent articles.

The .txt files in the folders on are the results from me running the program when I uploaded the files. Running aggregator.py will overwrite these files or create new ones if needed.

## To run the program
You only need to make sure the aggregator.py program is downloaded and that folders paths for Gaming/PC Gamer, Gaming/Games Radar, News/BBC, and News/CCN are in the same place as aggregator.py.

The aggregator.py then needs to be run with python. For windows, I used the powershell command 'python aggregator.py' and the program will run.

All .txt will be created if they are not in the folder. If the .txt are in there, they will be overwritten when the aggregator.py is run.
