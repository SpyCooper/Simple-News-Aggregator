----- Elton John serenaded at airport -----

“This boy’s too young to be singin’ the blues,” Elton John sings in
one of his biggest hits “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.”

And on Saturday, the legendary singer found himself singing with the
sky blue side of Manchester as he was serenaded by Manchester City
shortly after the team had won the FA Cup.

Pep Guardiola’s side had defeated its bitter rival Manchester United
2-1 at Wembley to keep its hopes of a ‘treble’ still standing, before
players and staff bumped into John at Manchester Airport on the tarmac
by a plane.

“Look who I ran into at Manchester Airport,” John posted on
Instagram, alongside a photo of himself holding the FA Cup with some
of City’s staff, including a grinning Guardiola. “Congratulations on
an incredible double. Fingers crossed for the treble.”

Saturday night’s alright! ✨@eltonofficial 👋 pic.twitter.com/iFq50iS8Qw

Videos posted by Manchester City showed John hugging each of the
players in turn as they walked past him, while Phil Foden even posed
for a selfie with the singer, before the team serenaded John with a
rendition of his famous “Your Song.”

“You can tell everybody, we’ve won the FA Cup,” City quipped.
