----- French Open -----

On a sun kissed but windy Parisian afternoon Novak Djokovic broke one
of Rafael Nadal’s French Open records as he progressed to the
quarterfinals at Roland Garros.

A straightforward 6-3 6-2 6-2 win over Peru’s Juan Pablo Varillas on
Sunday ensured Djokovic progressed to the last eight at the French
Open for a record 17th time, surpassing the absent Rafael Nadal on 16.

The win also inched the Serb closer to a men’s record 23rd career
grand slam. Djokovic is currently level with Nadal, who announced
Saturday that he would be out of action for at least five months after
undergoing hip surgery, on 22 grand slams.

Varillas is ranked 94th in the world but at Roland Garros became the
first Peruvian in 29 years to reach the fourth round of a grand slam.

He was no match for world No.3 Djokovic, however, who will next play
Russian Karen Khachanov, the 11th seed.

It has been a controversial week for the Serb who made headlines
after sending a political message about Kosovo earlier in the
tournament, something which he later said he stood by.

After his first round victory on Monday, Djokovic wrote “Kosovo is
the [heart symbol] of Serbia. Stop the violence” on a TV camera lens
in response to violent clashes in Kosovo. Tensions have been rising in
the past week in Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in
2008.

“Of course, I’m aware that a lot of people would disagree, but it is
what it is,” Djokovic said on Wednesday after his second-round victory
against Hungary’s Márton Fucsovics. “It’s something that I stand for.
So that’s all.”

“A drama-free grand slam, I don’t think it can happen for me,” he
added on Wednesday. “You know, I guess that drives me as well.”
